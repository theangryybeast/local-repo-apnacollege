# This is my local repo in which  i know about few things

first make any local folder to git one using "git init"

then use git remote add origin "link" to set this link as remote and name it origin

then we use "remote -v" to check which one is remote

then we check "branch" and rename it to main if != main

then we push our files to github
and used git push with "-u flag" which set origin as upstream link with which we no longer
need to write "git push origin main" always instead we use
"git push" only
